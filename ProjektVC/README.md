Spell-Checker, Three different algorithms compared

This Programm uses three different algorithms to correct misspelled words. It also uses a lexicon, which is made from any correct text. Additional entries can be added and stay longterm in the lexicon. Another feature is the analysis of the algorithms in matters of time an accuracy.

## Features ##

- [x] correction of misspelled words in any english text 
- [x] n-gram comparison
- [x] Jaccard coefficient
- [x] Damerau-Levenshtein 
- [x] adding own lexicon entries
- [x] comparing the algorithms (time and accuracy)

- [ ] saving the corrected texts in a .txt document
- [ ] adding language specific characters
